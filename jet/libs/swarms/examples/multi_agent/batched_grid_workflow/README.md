# BatchedGridWorkflow Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating various usage patterns of the `BatchedGridWorkflow` for parallel multi-agent task execution.

## Examples

### 1. `batched_grid_simple_example.py`
Basic usage examples with minimal configuration:
- Simple two-agent setup
- Named workflows with custom descriptions
- Multi-loop execution
- Three-agent workflows
- Error handling demonstration

### 2. `batched_grid_workflow_example.py`
Comprehensive examples covering different use cases:
- Content creation workflows
- Research and analysis tasks
- Problem-solving scenarios
- Educational content generation
- Multi-domain assessments

### 3. `batched_grid_advanced_example.py`
Advanced configuration examples:
- Custom conversation settings
- Iterative refinement workflows
- Specialized domain expertise
- Parallel analysis scenarios
- Creative collaboration
- Quality assurance workflows

## Usage

Each example can be run independently:

```bash
python batched_grid_simple_example.py
python batched_grid_workflow_example.py
python batched_grid_advanced_example.py
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working on different tasks simultaneously
- **Conversation Management**: Maintaining state across execution loops
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error logging and exception handling
- **Flexible Configuration**: Custom names, descriptions, and loop counts
- **Agent Specialization**: Different agents with specific roles and expertise
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple loops for content improvement
