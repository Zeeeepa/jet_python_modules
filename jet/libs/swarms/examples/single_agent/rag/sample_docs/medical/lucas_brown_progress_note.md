## Assessment
- Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (A1c 7.8% per recent labs).
- Suspected early heart failure (mild cardiomegaly on CXR, symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue).
- Anemia (Hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, likely contributing to fatigue).
- Hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL and triglycerides).

## Plan
- Order echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.
- Order iron studies and ferritin to assess anemia etiology.
- Increase Metformin to 1000 mg twice daily for better glycemic control.
- Refer to cardiology for further evaluation of chest tightness and cardiomegaly.
- Schedule follow-up in 2 weeks to review test results and adjust treatment.
