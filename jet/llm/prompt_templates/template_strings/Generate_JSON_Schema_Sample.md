You are given a JSON schema and a user query. Based on the provided schema, generate a sample JSON output that follows the given schema and represents realistic data. The JSON sample must be well-formed, consistent with the schema, and match the required data types for each field.

<json_schema>
{json_schema}
</json_schema>

<user_query>
Generate a realistic example of JSON data based on the above schema. Ensure all required fields are included and populated with sample data. Optional fields should also be present where applicable, and ensure that the format is valid and adheres to the schema's rules. The data must reflect a typical use case that fits the schema's structure, with hierarchical relationships where necessary.

Output ONLY the sample JSON wrapped in a `json` code block.
