### **Overall Insights on the Evaluation Report**

The evaluation report provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of various embedding models in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) context, focusing on **precision, recall, and MRR** across different **chunk sizes** (150, 250, 350). The findings highlight the following key observations:

---

#### **1. Model Performance Overview**
- **Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s** stands out as the **best performer** in terms of **precision** (0.2000) and **recall** (0.0154), with **MRR** of 0.3667. It excels in **retrieving highly relevant chunks** and **capturing most relevant chunks**.
- **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** and **sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1** show **moderate performance**, with **precision** and **recall** being relatively low (around 0.1556 and 0.0127, respectively).
- **Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s** has **lower MRR** compared to the other models, but it **outperforms** in **precision** and **recall**.

---

#### **2. Chunk Size Impact**
- **Chunk size 150** is the **optimal configuration** for **precision** and **recall**, with **Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s** achieving the highest precision (0.2000) and recall (0.0154).
- As chunk size increases to **250** and **350**, the **precision and recall** of all models remain **stable**, but **MRR** decreases slightly.
- This suggests that **chunk size** has a **minimal impact** on **recall** and **MRR**, but **precision** is **most sensitive** to chunk size.

---

#### **3. Strengths and Weaknesses**
- **Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s**:
  - **Strengths**: High precision, high recall, and good MRR.
  - **Weaknesses**: Low MRR due to poor ranking of relevant chunks.
- **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2**:
  - **Strengths**: High MRR (0.4333).
  - **Weaknesses**: Low precision (0.1556) and low recall (0.0127).
- **sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1**:
  - **Strengths**: High MRR (0.4000).
  - **Weaknesses**: Low precision (0.1333) and low recall (0.0108).

### **Recommendations for Improving RAG Context**

#### **1. Model Selection**
- **Use Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s** for **precision** and **recall** in RAG, especially when **chunk size is 150**.
- **Avoid sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** and **sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1** for high-precision retrieval tasks, as they suffer from **low precision** and **low recall**.

#### **2. Chunk Size Optimization**
- **Use chunk size 150** for **precision** and **recall**.
- **Increase chunk size** beyond 150 only if **MRR** can be improved through **ranking** or **re-ranking**.
- **Consider hybrid approaches** (e.g., combining multiple models) for **better recall** and **precision**.

#### **3. Ranking and Filtering**
- **Implement a ranking mechanism** to prioritize relevant chunks in the retrieval phase.
- **Use **re-ranking** or **post-processing** to filter out irrelevant chunks and improve MRR.

#### **4. Data Quality and Preprocessing**
- **Ensure high-quality, relevant data** for training the embedding model.
- **Preprocess data** to include **relevant metadata** (e.g., genres, studios, episode counts) to improve **recall** and **precision**.

#### **5. Evaluation Metrics**
- **Use **MRR** as the primary metric** for evaluating RAG performance, as it reflects **relevance** and **relevance ranking**.
- **Consider **precision** and **recall** for **specific tasks** (e.g., top-k retrieval).

#### **6. Model Tuning**
- **Fine-tune the model** for the specific **query types** (e.g., short vs. long queries).
- **Use **prompt engineering** or **query conditioning** to improve **relevance** and **ranking**.

---

### **Final Recommendations**
- **Opt for Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-s** with **chunk size 150** for **high precision** and **recall**.
- **Use chunk size 150** for **RAG** to balance **precision** and **recall**.
- **Implement ranking and filtering** to improve **MRR** and **relevance**.
- **Preprocess data** and **fine-tune models** for better performance on specific query types.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly improve the **relevance**, **precision**, and **recall** of your RAG system.
