Conclusion\n    The emergence of AI agents is undeniably reshaping the workplace landscape in 2024. With their ability to automate tasks, enhance efficiency, and improve decision-making, AI agents are critical in driving operational success. Organizations must embrace and adapt to AI developments to thrive in an increasingly digital business environment.\n    ```\n  </CodeGroup>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Note on Consistency in Naming\n\nThe names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.\nFor example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file.\nThis naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.\n\n#### Example References\n\n<Tip>\n  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.\n</Tip>\n\n```yaml agents.yaml\nemail_summarizer:\n    role: >\n      Email Summarizer\n    goal: >\n      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary\n    backstory: >\n      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report\n    llm: mixtal_llm\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.\n</Tip>\n\n```yaml tasks.yaml\nemail_summarizer_task:\n    description: >\n      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary\n    expected_output: >\n      A 5 bullet point summary of the email\n    agent: email_summarizer\n    context:\n      - reporting_task\n      - research_task\n```\n\nUse the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.\n\n### Annotations include:\n\n* `@agent`\n* `@task`\n* `@crew`\n* `@tool`\n* `@before_kickoff`\n* `@after_kickoff`\n* `@callback`\n* `@output_json`\n* `@output_pydantic`\n* `@cache_handler`\n\n```python crew.py\n# ...\n@agent\ndef email_summarizer(self) -> Agent:\n    return Agent(\n        config=self.agents_config[\"email_summarizer\"],\n    )\n\n@task\ndef email_summarizer_task(self) -> Task:\n    return Task(\n        config=self.tasks_config[\"email_summarizer_task\"],\n    )\n# ...\n```\n\n<Tip>\nIn addition to the [sequential process](../how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](../how-to/hierarchical-process),\nwhich automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results.\nYou can learn more about the core concepts [here](/concepts).\n</Tip>\n\n### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff\n\nCrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.\n\n```shell\ncrewai replay <task_id>\n```\n\nReplace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.\n\n### Reset Crew Memory\n\nIf you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:\n\n```shell\ncrewai reset-memories --all\n```\n\nThis will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.\n\n## Deploying Your Project\n\nThe easiest way to deploy your crew is through CrewAI Enterprise, where you can deploy your crew in a few clicks.\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Deploy on Enterprise\"\n    icon=\"rocket\"\n    href=\"http://app.crewai.com\"\n  >\n    Get started with CrewAI Enterprise and deploy your crew in a production environment with just a few clicks.\n  </Card>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Join the Community\"\n    icon=\"comments\"\n    href=\"https://community.crewai.com\"\n  >\n    Join our open source community to discuss ideas, share your projects, and connect with other CrewAI developers.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n",
