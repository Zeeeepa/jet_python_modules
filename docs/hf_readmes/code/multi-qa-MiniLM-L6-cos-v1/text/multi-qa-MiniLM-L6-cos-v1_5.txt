This bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.

## Training data

The RoBERTa model was pretrained on the reunion of five datasets:
- [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books;
- [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and headers) ;
- [CC-News](https://commoncrawl.org/2016/10/news-dataset-available/), a dataset containing 63 millions English news
  articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019.
- [OpenWebText](https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext), an opensource recreation of the WebText dataset used to
  train GPT-2,
- [Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847) a dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the
  story-like style of Winograd schemas.

Together theses datasets weight 160GB of text.

## Training procedure

### Preprocessing

The texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50,000. The inputs of
the model take pieces of 512 contiguous token that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked
with `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`

The details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:
- 15% of the tokens are masked.
- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.

- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.
- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.

Contrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).

### Pretraining

The model was trained on 1024 V100 GPUs for 500K steps with a batch size of 8K and a sequence length of 512. The
optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 4e-4, \\(\beta_{1} = 0.9\\), \\(\beta_{2} = 0.98\\) and
\\(\epsilon = 1e-6\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 30,000 steps and linear decay of the learning
rate after.

## Evaluation results

When fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:
