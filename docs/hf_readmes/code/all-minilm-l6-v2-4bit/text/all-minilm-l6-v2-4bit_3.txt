## FAQ

**1. Do I need to add the prefix "query: " and "passage: " to input texts?**

Yes, this is how the model is trained, otherwise you will see a performance degradation.

Here are some rules of thumb:
- Use "query: " and "passage: " correspondingly for asymmetric tasks such as passage retrieval in open QA, ad-hoc information retrieval.

- Use "query: " prefix for symmetric tasks such as semantic similarity, paraphrase retrieval.

- Use "query: " prefix if you want to use embeddings as features, such as linear probing classification, clustering.

**2. Why are my reproduced results slightly different from reported in the model card?**

Different versions of `transformers` and `pytorch` could cause negligible but non-zero performance differences.

**3. Why does the cosine similarity scores distribute around 0.7 to 1.0?**

This is a known and expected behavior as we use a low temperature 0.01 for InfoNCE contrastive loss. 

For text embedding tasks like text retrieval or semantic similarity, 
what matters is the relative order of the scores instead of the absolute values, 
so this should not be an issue.
