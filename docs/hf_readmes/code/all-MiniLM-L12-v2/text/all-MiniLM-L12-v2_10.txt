Note that, for reasons of space, this example does not show a complete cycle of calling a tool and adding the tool call and tool
results to the chat history so that the model can use them in its next generation. For a full tool calling example, please
see the [function calling guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating#advanced-tool-use--function-calling), 
and note that Mistral **does** use tool call IDs, so these must be included in your tool calls and tool results. They should be
exactly 9 alphanumeric characters.


## Limitations

The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. 
It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to
make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.
