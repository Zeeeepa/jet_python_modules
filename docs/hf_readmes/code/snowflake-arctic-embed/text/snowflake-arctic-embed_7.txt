## Acknowledgement


We want to thank the open-source community, which has provided the great building blocks upon which we could make our models.
We thank our modeling engineers, Danmei Xu, Luke Merrick, Gaurav Nuti, and Daniel Campos, for making these great models possible. 
We thank our leadership, Himabindu Pucha, Kelvin So, Vivek Raghunathan, and Sridhar Ramaswamy, for supporting this work. 
We also thank the open-source community for producing the great models we could build on top of and making these releases possible. 
Finally, we thank the researchers who created BEIR and MTEB benchmarks. 
It is largely thanks to their tireless work to define what better looks like that we could improve model performance.
