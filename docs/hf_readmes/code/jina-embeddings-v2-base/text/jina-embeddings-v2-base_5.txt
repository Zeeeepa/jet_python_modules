## Alternatives to Using Transformers (or SentencTransformers) Package

1. _Managed SaaS_: Get started with a free key on Jina AI's [Embedding API](https://jina.ai/embeddings/). 
2. _Private and high-performance deployment_: Get started by picking from our suite of models and deploy them on [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-stch2ludm6vgy).


## Use Jina Embeddings for RAG

According to the latest blog post from [LLamaIndex](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83),

> In summary, to achieve the peak performance in both hit rate and MRR, the combination of OpenAI or JinaAI-Base embeddings with the CohereRerank/bge-reranker-large reranker stands out.

## Plans

1. Bilingual embedding models supporting more European & Asian languages, including Spanish, French, Italian and Japanese.
2. Multimodal embedding models enable Multimodal RAG applications.
3. High-performt rerankers.

## Trouble Shooting

**Loading of Model Code failed**

If you forgot to pass the `trust_remote_code=True` flag when calling `AutoModel.from_pretrained` or initializing the model via the `SentenceTransformer` class, you will receive an error that the model weights could not be initialized.
This is caused by tranformers falling back to creating a default BERT model, instead of a jina-embedding model:
