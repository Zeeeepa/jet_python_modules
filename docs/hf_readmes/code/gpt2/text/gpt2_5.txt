This bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.

## Training data

The OpenAI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. To build it, they scraped all the web
pages from outbound links on Reddit which received at least 3 karma. Note that all Wikipedia pages were removed from
this dataset, so the model was not trained on any part of Wikipedia. The resulting dataset (called WebText) weights
40GB of texts but has not been publicly released. You can find a list of the top 1,000 domains present in WebText
[here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/domains.txt).

## Training procedure

### Preprocessing

The texts are tokenized using a byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a
vocabulary size of 50,257. The inputs are sequences of 1024 consecutive tokens.

The larger model was trained on 256 cloud TPU v3 cores. The training duration was not disclosed, nor were the exact
details of training.

## Evaluation results

The model achieves the following results without any fine-tuning (zero-shot):
