### Limitations and bias

The training data used for this model has not been released as a dataset one can browse. We know it contains a lot of
unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral. As the openAI team themselves point out in their
[model card](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/model_card.md#out-of-scope-use-cases):

> Because large-scale language models like GPT-2 do not distinguish fact from fiction, we donâ€™t support use-cases
> that require the generated text to be true.
>
> Additionally, language models like GPT-2 reflect the biases inherent to the systems they were trained on, so we do
> not recommend that they be deployed into systems that interact with humans > unless the deployers first carry out a
> study of biases relevant to the intended use-case. We found no statistically significant difference in gender, race,
> and religious bias probes between 774M and 1.5B, implying all versions of GPT-2 should be approached with similar
> levels of caution around use cases that are sensitive to biases around human attributes.

Here's an example of how the model can have biased predictions:
