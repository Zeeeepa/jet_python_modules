# Cross-Encoder for Semantic Textual Similarity
This model was trained using [SentenceTransformers](https://sbert.net) [Cross-Encoder](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) class.

## Training Data
This model was trained on the [STS benchmark dataset](http://ixa2.si.ehu.eus/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark). The model will predict a score between 0 and 1 how for the semantic similarity of two sentences. 


## Usage and Performance

Pre-trained models can be used like this:
