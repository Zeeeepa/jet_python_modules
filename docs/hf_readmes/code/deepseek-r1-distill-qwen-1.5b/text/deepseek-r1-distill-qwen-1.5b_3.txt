### Usage Recommendations

**We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:**

1. Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.
2. **Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.**
3. For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."
4. When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.

Additionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting "\<think\>\n\n\</think\>") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.
**To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with "\<think\>\n" at the beginning of every output.**
