### Usage for Reranker

Different from embedding model, reranker uses question and document as input and directly output similarity instead of embedding. 
You can get a relevance score by inputting query and passage to the reranker. 
The reranker is optimized based cross-entropy loss, so the relevance score is not bounded to a specific range.
