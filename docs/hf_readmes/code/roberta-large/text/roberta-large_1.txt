# RoBERTa large model

Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) and first released in
[this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta). This model is case-sensitive: it
makes a difference between english and English.

Disclaimer: The team releasing RoBERTa did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by
the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

RoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means
it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of
publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. 

More precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model
randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict
the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one
after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to
learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.

This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features
useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard
classifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for masked language modeling, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.
See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=roberta) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that
interests you.

Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)
to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text
generation you should look at model like GPT2.

### How to use

You can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:
